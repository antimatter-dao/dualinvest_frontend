# Antimatter - Dual Investment
Dual Invest offers a non-principal protected yield generating product. Enjoy high fixed yield no matter which direction the market goes. It is an advanced options derivative based on a decentralised protocol. The product has a "market-neutral, returns guaranteed" feature, where the yield is clear and fixed at the time of purchase, while the settlement currency is uncertain. At maturity, the settlement currency depends on the outcome of the settlement price at maturity compared to the strike price.
